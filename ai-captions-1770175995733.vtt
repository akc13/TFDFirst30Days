Hey,

1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.019
it's Alex again,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.230
here with Houston,

3
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.489
and we just wanted to say congratulations on finishing the 1st 30 days

4
00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:08.869
with the farmer's dog.

5
00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.060
Now you did more than switch to a new diet,

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.310
you noticed changes,

7
00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:13.859
you adjusted thoughtfully,

8
00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.250
and that's exactly what awesome pet parents like you do.

9
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.520
Every meal was more than just an opportunity to nourish your dog,

10
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.440
but to strengthen your bond

11
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.690
with each other.

12
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.290
And that steady care that you gave your dog over

13
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.930
these 30 days is going to support a longer,

14
00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.840
healthier life for you

15
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.080
and your best friend.

16
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.250
As you continue this journey with the Farmer's dog,

17
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.880
we're here to support you every step of the way.

18
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:41.689
We are so glad that you chose Fresh.

19
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.110
We hope you saw all the awesome benefits that we've seen

20
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.680
in the millions of dogs that we've helped throughout the years,

21
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.150
and we are so grateful

22
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.229
to have you as part of our farmer's dog community.
