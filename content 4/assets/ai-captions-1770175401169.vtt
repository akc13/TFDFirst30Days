Hi,

1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.850
I'm Alex,

2
00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.210
and this is Houston,

3
00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.010
and we're here to take you through your dog's transition

4
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:07.369
to the farmer's dog.

5
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.039
By getting started,

6
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.989
you've already made a great decision for your dog's health.

7
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.000
Real,

8
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.329
whole ingredients can support digestion,

9
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.010
energy,

10
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.549
and overall wellness.

11
00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:20.590
And you've already taken the first step.

12
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.840
In this course,

13
00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.610
we'll walk you through what to expect during your dog's 1st 30 days on fresh food,

14
00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:29.829
from early adjustments to the positive changes ahead,

15
00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:31.879
so that you don't have any problems.

16
00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.330
Right,

17
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.849
Houston?

18
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.759
By the end,

19
00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:37.540
you'll feel confident recognizing what's normal,

20
00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:38.740
what's exciting,

21
00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.240
and how to support your dog every step of the way.
